# classification-on-paid-Loan

In this project I practice all the classification algorithms on a dataset.

This dataset is about past loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.

For this project after cleaning data, I used k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.

For Evaluate the accuracy of models I used some metrics like Jaccard index, F1-score and LogLoass.
